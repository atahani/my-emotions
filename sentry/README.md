# Monitoring by Sentry

For educational purpose we run on-promise version of Sentry.

There is an [official instruction](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise) for running Sentry with docker. this setup bring up 24 container!

**[Also there is a an another setup with simpler configuration](https://gist.github.com/denji/b801f19d95b7d7910982c22bb1478f96), it has 5 service as well, but it doesn't have all of the Sentry features.**
